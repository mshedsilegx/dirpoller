# TESTING: DirPoller Unit Testing Suite

This document describes the comprehensive testing strategy and implementation for the DirPoller application, ensuring high code coverage and realistic behavior on Windows and Linux environments.

## 1. Architecture of the Test Suite

The DirPoller test suite is designed for high-fidelity simulation of system behaviors while maintaining strict isolation and cross-platform compatibility.

### 1.1 Test Strategy
The project employs a deliberate strategy to achieve 90%+ coverage by shifting from brittle OS-level manipulations to high-impact architectural refactorings. This approach focuses on:

- **Mocking Infrastructure**: Introducing thin interface wrappers for core external dependencies:
    - `internal/archive`: `ArchiveWriter` interface to wrap `tar.Writer` and `zstd.Writer` for injecting failures during I/O operations.
    - `internal/poller`: `Watcher` interface for `fsnotify` to manually inject events and errors without physical file operations.
    - `internal/service`: Abstraction of `CustomLogger`, `PlatformLogger`, and `EngineRunner` to hit all logging and lifecycle failure paths.
    - `internal/action`: Using `Dialer` and `SFTPClient` interfaces to simulate complex network and protocol failures. 
- **Efficiency Improvements**:
    - **Table-Driven Consolidation**: Combining multiple error path tests into single functions with multiple assertions.
    - **Synchronous Testing**: Using channel synchronization in mocks instead of `time.Sleep` to reduce test execution time.
    - **Targeted Iteration**: Using `go test -run <TestName>` for rapid development, only running full coverage reports upon package completion.

### 1.2 Component Testing Scenarios
The suite is divided into logical components, each with specific testing objectives:

- **Polling Engine (`internal/poller`)**: 
    - **Interval Poller**: Verified that files are detected at the exact configured frequency.
    - **Batch Poller**: Refactored to use `fsnotify` for immediate discovery. Tests verify that files are dispatched only when the batch count is reached or after a timeout fallback.
    - **Event Poller**: Uses real `fsnotify` events to simulate file system activity. Verified TTL-based cleanup of the debouncing map to ensure stability in high-traffic environments.
    - **Recursive Constraint**: Specifically tests that subfolder creation within a monitored directory triggers a failure/log as per the design specification.
- **Integrity Verification (`internal/integrity`)**: 
    - **Algorithm Support**: Comprehensive tests for `Size`, `Hash (XXH3-128)`, and `Timestamp` algorithms.
    - **Consistency Check**: Simulates partial file writes by modifying files during the verification interval to ensure the verifier waits for the file to be "quiet".
    - **Lock Detection**: Validates Windows-native `CreateFile` with `FILE_SHARE_NONE` behavior and POSIX lock detection on Linux.
- **Action Handlers (`internal/action`)**: 
    - **Script Action**: Generates platform-specific test scripts (`.bat`/`.ps1` on Windows, `.sh` on Linux). Verifies parallel execution via worker pools and **Timeout Enforcement** for long-running scripts.
    - **Common Logic**: Verifies **Multi-Error Reporting** using `errors.Join` to ensure all failures in a batch are surfaced.
- **System Service (`internal/service`)**: 
    - Refactored to use a `ServiceManager` interface to allow full testing without administrator/root privileges.
    - **Control Loop**: Simulates service signals (Stop, Pause, Continue) to verify the Engine's response to state changes.
    - **Windows Native**: Verified using `winsvc` mocks for installation and removal.
    - **Linux Systemd**: Verified using a specialized test suite that runs as a regular user but uses `sudo` for unit file operations and `systemctl` commands.
- **Custom Logging (`internal/service`)**: 
    - **Execution Logging**: Verified that `CustomLogger` creates datestamped log files with correct structure (Status, Success, Errors).
    - **Log Retention**: Tests simulate old log files and verify they are purged based on the `log_retention` days setting.
    - **Empty Log Prevention**: Verified that no log file is created if no files were processed in an execution cycle.
- **CLI Orchestration (`cmd/dirpoller`)**: Refactored to separate orchestration from process exit logic for 90%+ bootstrap coverage. Separated `main()` into a testable `run()` function.
- **Shared Test Utilities (`internal/testutils`)**: Centralized mocks (`MockSFTPClient`, `MockOSUtils`, `MockLogger`) that are self-tested to ensure reliable behavior across the suite.

## 2. Technical Requirements and Setup

### 2.1 Dependencies
- **Go Version**: Go 1.21+ (utilizing `errors.Join` and modern testing features).
- **External Packages**: 
    - `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify`
    - `github.com/pkg/sftp`
    - `github.com/spf13/afero` (MemMapFs)
    - `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`
    - `golang.org/x/sys/windows`

### 2.2 Environment Variables and Setup
To ensure tests do not interfere with source code or production data, all tests use a dedicated temporary directory.

- **Environment Variables**:
    - `%TEMP%` (Windows) or `$TMPDIR`/`$TEMP` (Linux): Used to determine the base test directory.
- **Base Directory**: `%TEMP%\dirpoller_UTESTS` (Windows) or `$TMPDIR/dirpoller_UTESTS` (Linux).
- **Isolation**: Each test case or package uses a unique subdirectory (e.g., `.../dirpoller_UTESTS/poller`).
- **Lifecycle Management**:
    - `TestMain`: Each package contains a `TestMain` that ensures the parent directory exists.
    - **Per-Test Cleanup**: Subdirectories are cleaned up *before* each test runs to ensure a deterministic state.
- **Parallelism**: Global cleanup in `TestMain` is avoided to prevent race conditions when Go runs multiple package tests simultaneously.

### 2.3 Constraints
- **OS Portability**: Tests use `filepath.Join` and `filepath.ToSlash` to remain platform-agnostic. Security boundary tests are mocked to simulate Windows-specific path restrictions and Linux-specific permission checks.
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Ensure mutexes are not held when calling methods that internally acquire the same lock (e.g., `getOrCreateClient`).

## 5. Realistic Data Simulation

### 5.1 SFTP High-Fidelity Mock Server
The SFTP action handler is tested using a high-fidelity, in-memory mock SFTP server implemented in `internal/action/sftp_mock_server_test.go`. This server uses `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`, `github.com/pkg/sftp` and `afero.MemMapFs` to provide a realistic testing environment.

- **Auth Matrix Mode**: Supports User+Pass, User+Key, and User+Pass+Key (MFA).
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Implements full TCP listen, SSH handshake, channel handling, subsystem request, and SFTP initialization.
- **Integration**: Validates real-world authentication, file transfer success, and host key verification.

### 5.2 File System Activity Simulation
- **fsnotify Events**: Real `ReadDirectoryChangesW` (Windows) and `inotify` (Linux) events are used to simulate live activity.
- **Consistency Verification**: Modification of files during the verification interval is simulated to test verifier stability logic.
- **Subfolder detection**: Verification that subfolder creation triggers the expected design behavior.

## 6. How to Run the Tests

### 6.1 Linux Service Testing (Regular User with Sudo)
The Linux service installer test suite (`internal/service/service_linux_test.go`) is designed to be executed by a **regular user**. It does not require the entire test process to be run as root. Instead, it leverages `sudo` internally for specific operations that require elevation:

- **Deployment**: Writing the template to `/etc/systemd/system/`.
- **Management**: Invoking `systemctl` for daemon-reload and enablement.

**Prerequisites**:
1. The user must have `sudo` privileges.
2. The tests use `exec.Command("sudo", ...)` to elevate as needed.

### 6.2 Windows (PowerShell)
Run the entire suite with coverage reporting:
```powershell
# Standard run
go test ./... -v -cover

# Detailed coverage breakdown
go test ./... -coverprofile="$env:TEMP\total.cov"; if ($?) { go tool cover -func="$env:TEMP\total.cov" }
```

### 6.3 Linux (Bash)
Run the entire suite with coverage reporting:
```bash
# Standard run
go test ./... -v -cover

# Detailed coverage breakdown
go test ./... -coverprofile="$TEMP/total.cov" && go tool cover -func="$TEMP/total.cov"
```

## 7. Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### 7.1 Troubleshooting Common Failures
- **Path Length Errors**: On Windows, ensure `TEMP` does not exceed length limits if using deep nesting.
- **Permission Denied**: If running tests that simulate Windows Service installation without mocks, ensure the shell is elevated (though current tests use mocks to avoid this).
- **Hanging Tests**: Usually caused by unbuffered channels in mocks or `engine.Run` not receiving a cancellation signal. Use `context.WithTimeout` in new tests.

### 7.2 Maintenance Guidelines
- **Adding New Features**: Ensure any new external dependency is wrapped in an interface and added to `internal/testutils`.
- **Refactoring**: When refactoring `main` or `service` logic, ensure mock variables in `main.go` are updated and tests still use `defer` for restoration.
- **Coverage Maintenance**: Periodically run the full coverage suite to ensure no package drops below 90%.
- **Safety**: Global variables (`os.Args`, mock functions) must be restored using `defer` to ensure test independence.
